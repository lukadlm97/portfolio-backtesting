Repository for developing portfolio optimizer using Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Project Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to discover the potential of python library Backtesting.py (link: https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/) for portfolio analysis. 
In this project, we will test different trading strategies, with goals to determine which one is the best for feature investments.

All experiments will be done on datasets fetched from yahoo finance, on different symbols and stocks (preferable cryptos and forex symbols)
The result will be generated by backtesting.py packages, all trades, orders, portfolio stats etc.
Optimization will be done using some modules from a scikit-learn package.

Finale GOAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Create profitable strategies with optimal parameters to make me a millionaire!!!
